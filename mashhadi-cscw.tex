\title[The Impact of Social Inequality in AirBnB]{Who Gets the Lion's Share in the Sharing Economy: The Impact of Social Inequality in AirBnB}


\begin{abstract}
Sharing economy platforms have rapidly disrupted and transformed many traditional markets. Companies such as AirBnB, in the housing market, and Uber, in the ride-sharing space, have thrived by creating opportunities for so-called ``micro-entrepreneurs'', allowing them to leverage existing personal assets, such as a spare room or car, to generate additional income. While often heralded as an opportunity to reduce income inequality, opening opportunities through technology to a much larger segment of the population, there is however a latent concern that these platforms are in practice not as inclusive as advertised.

Looking specifically at \ab, issues of inequality and discrimination on the platform have started to attract the attention of the research community. There is however no clear understanding of how this inequality manifests itself. As a starting point, we must ask the question of who benefits the most from the use of this platform: specifically who the hosts are, their background, and what they offer.

%In this paper we study over 14K listings of AirBnB properties in Chicago. To quantify the extent of social inequality, we examine a number of different dimensions regarding the hosts, their property and the environment within which they operate. Specifically we examine who the hosts are by detecting hosts' ethnicity, gender and age using images posted publicly on the site. Leveraging this information and socio-economic metrics from the Census, we examine the properties different hosts offer and what is received in return. Finally we also study how these hosts present their properties by measuring the aesthetic score of the main listing photographs using a deep learning algorithm.  
%
%Our results suggest an ethnical discrepancy that affects minorities from lower socio-economic backgrounds, even when taking into account location and other attributes such as price of \ab \ listings. The findings also suggest that a wider range of factors may be affecting hosts than ethnic discrimination by the customer, such as poorer pictures of listings, that could be corrected with relative ease with appropriate assistance of the platform owners.
