In this paper we studied the demographics of Chicago \ab \  hosts to understand the impact of  social inequality in the sharing economy platform.  Our results show that listings are typically geographically located in richer and denser areas with respect to median household income, and that minorities are under-represented even in minority-majority areas. Furthermore, we showed that social inequality  manifests itself not only in the lack  of participation of the minorities but also in the way they present their listings visually and listing prices.  We showed that  the potential earnings of  African-Americans hosts appear to be 12\% less than that of other hosts for the same type of property in the same location.  In our study we did not observe any  unequal treatment of female or elderly hosts.
